## X42

This is a sample project which contains a simple program written in multiple different languages, which prints out `What is the meaning of life?` to `stdout` unless the value of its first parameter is `42` in which case it writes 'It depends!` to `stderr` and exists with an error code of 42.

### Getting Started

Use the Makefile in the individual language directories to build the binaries for your system.
