## X42

This is a sample project which contains a simple program written in multiple different languages, which prints out `What is the meaning of life?` to `stdout` unless the value of its first parameter is `42` in which case it exists with an exception.

### Getting Started

Use the Makefile to build the binary for your system and language of choice.
